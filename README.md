# Boilerplate System

This system is a boilerplate system that you can use as a starting point for building your own custom systems. It's similar to Simple World-building, but has examples of creating attributes in code rather than dynamically through the UI.

## Usage

Testing out Boilerplate to create custom DND system.

## Sheet Layout

This system includes a handful of helper CSS classes to help you lay out your sheets if you're not comfortable diving into CSS fully. Those are:

* `flexcol`: Included by Foundry itself, this lays out the child elements of whatever element you place this on vertically.
* `flexrow`: Included by Foundry itself, this lays out the child elements of whatever element you place this on horizontally.
* `flex-center`: When used on something that's using flexrow or flexcol, this will center the items and text.
* `flex-between`: When used on something that's using flexrow or flexcol, this will attempt to place space between the items. Similar to "justify" in word processors.
* `flex-group-center`: Add a border, padding, and center all items.
* `flex-group-left`: Add a border, padding, and left align all items.
* `flex-group-right`: Add a border, padding, and right align all items.
* `grid`: When combined with the `grid-Ncol` classes, this will lay out child elements in a grid.
* `grid-Ncol`: Replace `N` with any number from 1-12, such as `grid-3col`. When combined with `grid`, this will layout child elements in a grid with a number of columns equal to the number specified.
